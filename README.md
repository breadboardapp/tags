# Breadboard's ignored tag list
This repository contains a list of meta or otherwise very generic tags that are commonly used on popular imageboards.

Breadboard will ignore any tag in this list when recommending new content in order to prioritise tags (and therefore artwork) that you're more likely to care about.

The Breadboard app also contains its own internal list of ignored tags.
When the Breadboard app receives an update, its internal list should be up-to-date with this repository.
Breadboard 3.1 and newer allow you to keep the app's internal list up to date with this repository without needing an app update, ensuring you are always being served the best content.

Suggestions for additions or removals are welcome.
